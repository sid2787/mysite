<!-- Hey! Welcome to my first attempt at a portfolio!
Lol I know that I already know all this stuff,
but I'm just taking it slow, one step at a time. -->

    <p>In a nutshell, a professional procrastinator and a super lazy human being with a great sense of humour ;P. I was
    not super enthusiastic about any tech field as much as I am about web development.. I know that it's just the beginning
  but the very fact that I took the effort to make this site (inspite of my very appealing characteristics mentioned above XD)
 shows how much I'm hooked onto this field and how I continuously want to keep learning more and more.. A feeling that I never
  previously experienced with any other field of technology.. Hopefully I can move forward with this same enthusiasm and
  build more exciting sites in the near future ;)
